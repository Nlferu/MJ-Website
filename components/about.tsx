                Hello! I'm Marta. Since high school, I have known that I want to be an accountant. Determined to turn my passion into a profession, I pursued a
                comprehensive education, earning both a bachelor's and master's degree from the prestigious University of Economics in Krakow.
                <span className="my-4">
                    My professional journey has taken me through diverse landscapesâ€”from a dynamic small accounting office to a bustling corporation, and
                    finally to a unique hybrid that seamlessly blends both sectors. Along the way, I took charge of managing a branch of an accounting office,
                    gaining invaluable hands-on experience in human resources management.
                </span>
                With two years of expertise under my belt in the latter area, I'm driven to continuously enhance my skills in this ever-evolving field and
                ambitiously expand my competencies. I'm fueled by a genuine passion for the intricacies of accounting and the dynamic realm of human resources.
